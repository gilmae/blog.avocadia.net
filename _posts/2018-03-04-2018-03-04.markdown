## Mute
Theyâ€™re saying Charlie Brooker has announced that all Black Mirror episodes take place in a shared world. That doesnâ€™t annoy or frustrate me, I canâ€™t quite get agitated about it. But it leaves me a fraction more exhausted. Fandom exhausts me with its neediness, like a dog constantly going back to the bowl between meals just in case something it missed materialises.
So I could have done without the scene tying _Mute_ to _Moon_, but all in all I recognise that it could have been much more contrived.
Its pretty good but definitely flawed. Skarsgard is really good; Rudd was ok.  I donâ€™t know how I feel about a constant stream of all-male casts in movies revolving around the murdered woman. Whatever I feel,  winking at the women-in-fridge trope was on the nose. And yeah, why the Moon connection? Did they not trust that Duncan Jones would have enough reputation to bring an audience?
I preferred Moon but I think the critical reaction is harsh.

## The Culture
Speaking of fandom, I donâ€™t believe Amazon, a rapacious capitalist organisation set on exploiting every aspect of humanity and sucking the human community dry to get a few more dollars into the pockets of a oligarchic fewâ€¦

I donâ€™t believe that kind of vampire squid can possibly produce an adaption of The Culture books that doesnâ€™t end up being basically Star Trek,

So despite being leery of the news that , [the vampire squid will be creating Star Trek by another name](https://www.space.com/39795-amazon-making-the-culture-sci-fi-tv-series.html), I started reading the books again. I skipped _Consider Phlebas_ but remembered why I liked _Player of Games_ so much. Iâ€™d forgotten most of _Use of Weapons_, and I just stumbled across a detail in _Excession_ I had never noticed before, so thatâ€™s nice.

## My Teen Diary
Not quite my teen diary, but D had a joke about me finding and restoring the 2002-2006 version of this blog.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So <a href="https://twitter.com/gilmae?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gilmae</a> has resurrected an old blog. Itâ€™s the modern equivalent of reading your teen diary</p>&mdash; Donna (@randomknits) <a href="https://twitter.com/randomknits/status/969159970548690944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

What I found was, hidden away in a folder, a zip pf the code from my blog engine. It was the first project of any size I created for myself. And the database is still siting out on my host, so I just took a snapshot and restored everything on my laptop. It was all broken, but getting it up and running again was a lot easier than I had anticipated - wasnâ€™t the weekend long project I thought it would be, it was all over on Friday night.

Yeah, baby. Friday night spent fixing 16 year old PHP code to make it work in v7. Rock on ðŸ¤˜!

Anyway, not a single character of the content will see the light of day. The worst bit was being reminded what I thought of Mark Latham. Ugh!

## Scratch
However, I have been writing things in PHP again. Partially because I am reacting to [Contempt Culture](https://blog.aurynn.com/contempt-culture) but I was also intrigued by another blog post, [Stop writing PHP like itâ€™s 2009â€¦ â€“ Florianâ€™s Blog](https://florian-laplantif.com/2017/07/18/stop-writing-php-like-its-2009/). I canâ€™t say that I am completely living up to that call to action - because I was also inspired by [Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/routing-simple-requests) to start [writing a web framework from scratch](https://www.twitch.tv/garybernhardt/videos/all). 
I was writing a simple reference site to test out the framework I created. I will still finish that, but I think I will try and re-build my old blog in this new framework.
Because why not?

I have been on holidays since I left work at 14:00 December 23rd, 2015.

Since then I have:

1. Hosted Christmas[1], roasting three chickens and a pork, and constructing a trifle.
2. Constructed a [garden shed](/images/posts/20160110/IMG_2293_1024.jpg), which was a pleasure[2].
3. Had three and a half tonne[3] of garden soil delivered, which I then moved from [the driveway](/images/posts/20160110/IMG_2296_1024.jpg) to [the garden](/images/posts/20160110/IMG_2299_1024.jpg).

So...finally something got [finished](http://blog.avocadia.net/blog/2015/01/01/i-start-things/).

1.   Only one hospital visit required, and the [thing was ok enough afterwards](/images/posts/20160110/IMG_2288_1024.jpg "A child makes light of concussive injuries").


2.   Two person job with just me and D with her injured shoulder; had to re-drill many holes; got sunburnt; only one mistake; it still stands.

3.   And googled tonne vs ton more times than I care to admit because I just can't get which is which to stick.

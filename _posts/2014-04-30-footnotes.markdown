I switched from using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) to [Atom](https://atom.io) for a time to try it out.

One thing was annoying the hell out of me - no package to add footnotes with a key-chord. I had gotten used to shift-cmd-6 to insert footnotes in Sublime Text.

It's the usual open source story. I waited for one to show up, and it never did. So I wrote my own and published it<sup><a name="fni1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.

Search for 'footnoter' if you can and wish to use it.

And [fix it as well](https://github.com/gilmae/footnoter), if you like.

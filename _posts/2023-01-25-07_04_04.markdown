Shit is still settling down after the second round of redundancies at my employer in six months. Was giving some feedback to a be of my recent hires who took over my old team. For six months I had been cleaning up the mess of the first round by being people manger for the twenty people who lost their old manager, in addition to the then I already had. In giving that feedback I really saw clearly how much collateral damage was inflicted on everyone. Not a single one of the people I needed to support got my best; there simply wasn’t enough butter for all the bread. So people have missed opportunities for personal growth, or been left anxious because they weren’t getting enough help or advice or feedback. People have left. People who stayed are probably scarred. I know I am.

Redundancies in the name of Line Must Go Up are a moral wrong.

precis: To cleanse my palette and try - again - to write regularly, a media diet
---

Lots of my friends are trying to re-focus on blogging this year. Ok. One of my friends. 

She says recommendations are an easy win. She has certainly done some of that. Recommended a game that came chillingly close to eating my life. Thanks for that, [Kris](https://www.web-goddess.org/archive/18353).

One of the things I wanted to get out of last year was finishing things. One of those things was going to be a tool for writing, storing, and publishing my reactions (“review” seems like too strong a word for what I write) to things I read, watch, and listen to. It didn't get finished, I kind of got sidetracked by also trying to build a web site framework, as a way of relearning PHP. If it had, it would have been the perfect tool for creating a blog post of recommendations.

On a side track, Gary Bernhardt did a live coding session on Twitch earlier this week, [Build a web app and framework from scratch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/220261802), and I have been inspired to take another run at that PHP framework again. I had to stop watching that video so that I didn't just re-implement his own thing.

Anyway.

I can’t do a full on [media diet post like Kottke](https://kottke.org/tag/media%20diet). I never did write down most of what I thought about the thing I was consuming. Maybe a lot of it just ended up making no real impression on me. Like, Game of Thrones and The Magicians show. They’re ok in the moment, but they’re pretty and empty. About the only albums I really remember were from [Halsey](https://www.vevo.com/watch/halsey/strangers-(audio)/USUV71701262), [Lorde](https://www.vevo.com/watch/lorde/the-louvre-(vevo-x-lorde)/NZUV71700022), and [Cherry Glazer]( https://www.vevo.com/watch/cherry-glazerr/told-you-id-be-with-the-guys-(official-video)/US38W1634512). Surely there were more albums I listened to and cared about , even if only in the moment? 

I apparently didn’t read much either if you go off Goodreads; pretty sure I didn’t even rate let alone review about half a dozen books. Latest entries in [Laundry Files series](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32063117-the-delirium-brief), [The Expanse](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25877663-babylon-s-ashes), and from [Max Gladstone](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31433704-the-ruin-of-angels?from_search=true) were welcome. I really need to re-read the last. I also need to re read [Total Propaganda: Basic Marxist Brainwashing for the Angry and the Young by Helen Razer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36043049-total-propaganda) because I just didn’t grasp finer points. [October: The Story of the Russian Revolution by China Miéville](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31578250-october?from_search=true) was great. Pretty sure I’m not a proper communist but quite certain I’m not even a little bit here for late stage capitalism.

I enjoyed the hell out of two shows, [The Americans](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2149175/episodes?season=5&ref_=tt_eps_sn_5) and [Halt and Catch Fire](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543312/episodes?season=4&ref_=tt_eps_sn_4). The slower season of The Americans wasn’t too popular, but I thought it was fantastic.  It could go a few ways in the final season and I’m hoping for something blemish, because apparently that’s my thing. It can’t be completely my thing though because Donna and Cameron becoming friends again was the Best Thing of 2017 and made me cry.

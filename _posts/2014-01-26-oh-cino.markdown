At the risk of this blog turnng into the [Adventure Capital](http://blog.avocadia.net/blog/2014/01/11/adventure-capital/) making of, it turns out I am going to write this damn thing. It's already made it off my local system out to [Github](https://github.com/gilmae/AdventureCapital).

I doubt it will ever be more than a toy I play with occasionally, but if it were, that's almost certainly a prototype. Porting it to c# would give me more flexibility, such as mobile device apps. Ha! Look at me talk.

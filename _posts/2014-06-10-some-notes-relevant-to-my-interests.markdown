### Interviews
[What I Learned Doing 250 Interviews at Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8RxkpUvxK0)

I've done some posts on interviews, which I more or less still agree with. I'm not working in Google or Microsoft, I'm in an agency with considerably fewer engineering standards. Still, there's a lot here that still works outside the mileu of 7 or 8 1 hr interviews in a day per candidate.

In particular asking questions that can be drilled down into. The Number Swap question really is a Junior Dev kind of question - despite the depressing number of people who couldn't give even the naive/best solution.

Meanwhile, Etsy, eh? I was vaguely aware they were doing a lot of developer community outreach - I've seen a lot of Code as Craft fly through my feeds - but it has taken some time for it to dawn on me they are just an interesting dev shop as Facebook/Google/Amazon. More so than the first two, I suppose, from a ethical point of view.

### Rugby League
1. [Brent Tate's post-State of Origin comments anger NSW players](http://www.smh.com.au/sport/brent-tates-poststate-of-origin-comments-anger-nsw-players-20140531-zrtdu.html)
2. [Brent Tate's critics should hang their heads in shame](http://www.smh.com.au/sport/the-fitz-files/brent-tates-critics-should-hang-their-heads-in-shame-20140606-zrznt.html)

Meanwhile, I did watch the first game of the State of Origin series. Oh and look, a pair of fucking dickheads lifted another player into a dangerous postion and dropped him. I'm biased though, right, because it was a Queensland player and I support Queenslander. Oh, but it's all okay, because Wally Lewis - the Queenslander's Queenslander in the 80's - said mid-game there was no malice and he's a one-eyed Queenslander.

And, and the guy escaped suspension with sufficient downgrading of the grading of the offense. So yeah, fuck the NRL. I don't see myself staying away from the Origin games, but I won't be watching the NRL competition itself any more.

### Swift
WWDC tends to leave me reasonably buzzed anyway, but I almost paid the $99 to become an Apple Developer just so I could pull the XCode beta just to play with Swift.

I didn't, because the chances of me doing anything more than playing are vanishingly small.

### D&D
Won't buy. Will download the [free "basic" intro PDF](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/134812-Dungeons-Dragons-Launch-Will-Include-Free-Basic-D-D-Book). Still want to play Original or 1st ed again. Still not looking for a game, because I still have a very jaundiced view of Skype+computerised-tabletops.

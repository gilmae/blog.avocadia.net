<p>Scene - Earlier today</p>

<p>me: Ok, fuck this, I'm going to fix the OpenTelemetry stuff. I'm sick of all the traces being lost. I'll just switch the config to what Honeycomb tells me to do.</p>

<p><two hours of careful package updating (why are they all prerelease packagesâ€½?)</p>

<p>me: Ok, that's done, just need to update the .env files. Huh, look at that, the honeycomb settings were all mistyped. um...ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬</p>

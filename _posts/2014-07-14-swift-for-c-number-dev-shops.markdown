precis: I made some slides. They're totes rad.

I did a short - 5 minute - presentation at work on Swift. It seemed to go over well. I uploaded it to [the cloud](http://slides.com/gilmae/swift-for-c-shops#/).

Meanwhile, TIL that two of the slide deck sharing sites I knew, slideshare and slides, are just The Worst. 200 char limit for speakers notes? I'm sureprofessional speakers have no interest in sharing a transcript of what they said, but I do. 200 characters? Pah!

(I am on a free account, of course :-)

<p>Been an awful twenty four hours. I think I’ve come to the end of my tolerance for putting my anxiety and stress in the hands of a narcissist focussed only on his vanity project. And it’s perfect timing to change employers when there are so many layoffs occurring in tech, right?</p>

<p>Anyway, going to settle down with a relaxing podcast about (checks) the Life and Crimes of Nicolae Ceaușescu. Oh goody.</p>

## Sydney Tech Leaders
On Thursday evening past I helped co-host a tech meet up, Sydney Tech Leaders. It was my first time.

Not going to the Meetup, I’ve been doing that for a couple of years now. It was my first time hosting something. Well, co-hosting.

I’m still not sure really what to make of it all. I hardly did anything in the lead up or on the night itself. 

I got into it when my friend, Kris Howard, asked for help when she had a lot on. I _thought_ I was going to be helping her out with…I don’t know, something. Picking up some minor tasks that needed doing. I was a little surprised when suddenly I was a co-organiser. Ok, I can do this.

That was about a month ago. I spent that month not really knowing how I can help. The two original founders, Owen Senior and Ted Tencza,  are men I know only really by reputation but have a lot of respect for. It’s their group. Their’s and Kris’s. They have the contacts with speakers and venues.

Thursday night showed me how I can contribute. We forgot to time the first speaker. We need cards to hold up for the speaker to see when they reach time marks. We need to make sure they have a glass of water, the right AV dongles. We need to make sure someone knows how to use Windows, Linux, and macOS with a projector, and slides, and slide notes. Little things but they make a difference.

## Media Diet
It’s no good that **The Expanse** is currently in limbo. It’s a good show albeit one I suspect I’m mostly watching because there’s no other space sci fi shows going. It’s pretty tangential from the books now, although the bigger beats from the books keep cropping up. I suspect Sci Fi is cutting it loose because the storyline is about to become untethered from the inter-planetary conflict and the budget for certain FX will go way up.

**Legion** is great. Watch it.

**Dirty Computer** keeps surfacing a new little 80s-Prince-like lick every time I listen. Just moments in great Janelle Monae songs.

I didn’t watch Grey’s Anatomy, maybe a few episodes, so I didn’t know what I would be getting from Sandra Oh in  **Killing Eve**. This is my favourite show right now, and I love that the major cast are all women. Oh, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge is the creator.

I probably won’t last any longer with **The Handmaid’s Tale**. If this show is just going to wallow in endless degradation of women and keep dangling hope before ripping it away…well, I don’t like horror.

I read [**Amberlogh**](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1884262679?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1). Conveniently, the second book just came out and the worst character isn’t in it. I suppose that just means that the author is saving him for the conclusion.
